TTYPE reads your text from a file or stdin, or accepts it as a parameter. Then
your text is typed on a virtual keyboard so as a result, it appears in the
same terminal where you invoked ttype. The advantage comparing to 'echo' or
'cat' is that you can edit the text in terminal, and then for instance use it
as a command. ttype accepts text which is encoded in UTF-8.
