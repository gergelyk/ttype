DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TTYPE reads your text from a file or stdin, or accepts it as a parameter. Then
your text is typed on a virtual keyboard so as a result, it appears in the
same terminal where you invoked ttype. The advantage comparing to 'echo' or
'cat' is that you can edit the text in terminal, and then for instance use it
as a command. ttype accepts text which is encoded in UTF-8.

TTYPE works for both, "real" terminal and terminal emulator under X session.


REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following files must be present in file system to let TTYPE work:

   /dev/uinput or /dev/input/uinput
   /proc/sys/kernel/printk

In addition, TTYPE requires following commands to be available:

   dumpkeys  (only for terminal)
   xte       (only for X)
   setxkbmap (only for X)

In order to install them try:

   # apt-get install console-tools xautomation x11-xkb-utils


TTYPE has been tested in Debian 3.2.32-1 x86_64 GNU/Linux.

BUILDING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TTYPE requires root privileges in order to create virtual keyboard. In order
to let regular user use TTYPE, sticky bit should be set to 1. However, this
doesn't make sense in case of a script. This is why ttype.py should be
compiled to executable version first. In order to do that you need Freeze or
similar software.

1. Obtain Freeze from:

     http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Tools/freeze/

2. Configure Freeze.

   It may ne required to create a symlink to config:

   # cd /usr/lib/python2.7 
   # sudo ln -s config-x86_64-linux-gnu/ config

   Or install some packages, for example zlib1g-dev:

   # apt-get install zlib1g-dev

   For more help, please refer to documentation of Freeze

3. Convert ttype.py to C and build

   $ freeze ttype.py
   $ make


INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   # cp ttype /usr/bin/
   # chmod +s /usr/bin/ttype
